# TypeScript Practice Repository

This repository exists solely as a sandbox for practicing **TypeScript**.  
It is not a production project, portfolio piece, or finished application.  
Expect messy code, experiments, and plenty of trial and error.

---

## Purpose

- Explore TypeScript syntax and language features
- Build familiarity with type safety, interfaces, generics, and more
- Practice refactoring JavaScript code into TypeScript
- Gain comfort with tooling, configs, and compilation

---

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/msecondi/TypeScript-Practice
   cd TypeScript-Practice

## How to Run
You can run the project in two ways: directly with TypeScript (ts-node) or by compiling it first.

Option 1: Run in Development

Run TypeScript files directly without compiling:

npm run dev

Option 2: Compile and Run

Compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript:

npm run build

Then run the compiled JavaScript code:

npm start
